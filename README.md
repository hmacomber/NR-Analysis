# NR-Analysis
Scripts and data used in the creation of "[A Thalamic-Hippocampal CA1 Signal for Contextual Fear Memory Suppression, Extinction, and Discrimination](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.534420v1)"

Contained in this repository are the Python and R scripts used in the creation of this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.534420v1), as well as datasets used in the creation of all paper figures, including shock data: `shock_behavior.pkl`, NR axonal traces `traces.pkl`, and mouse behavior stored on an external google drive found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJl73Oknp7RNM1oQ8t0EW-6npI0PhJvO/view?usp=sharing). 

It additionally includes the code used to generate figures and some statistics `NR_Analysis_Paper.ipynb` some additional mouse behavior statistics `r_stats.R` which rely on the csv files `pf_dark.csv`, `pf_exp_days.csv` and `pf_imaged.csv` and original pre-processing code `pre-processing.py` for methodological reference. Original, raw data is too large to include in this repository as it contains multiple terabytes, but access to raw files can be arranged by contacting sheffield@uchicago.edu.
