# NR-Analysis
Scripts and data used in the creation of "[A Thalamic-Hippocampal CA1 Signal for Contextual Fear Memory Suppression, Extinction, and Discrimination](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.534420v1)"

Contained in this repository are the Python and R scripts used in the creation of this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.534420v1), as well as datasets used in the creation of all paper figures, including mouse behavior: `all_behavior.pkl`, shock data: `shock_behavior`, NR axonal traces `traces`, and the two computational models used: `results_normalized_axon` for the main computational model, and `results_across_mice.pkl` for the cross-mouse trained model in the supplement. 

It additionally includes the code used to generate figures and some statistics `NR_Analysis_Paper.ipynb` some additional mouse behavior statistics `r_stats.R` which rely on the csv files `pf_dark`, `pf_exp_days` and `pf_imaged` and original pre-processing code `pre-processing.py` for methodological reference. Original, raw data is too large to include in this repository as it contains multiple terabytes, but can access to raw files can be arranged by contacting sheffield@uchicago.edu.
